 # Exercise
 Now you have learned the concept of the Pyramid of Pain. Maybe it is time to apply this in practice. Please, navigate to the Static Site to perform the exercise. 

You can pick any APT (Advanced Persistent Threat Groups) as another exercise. A good place to look at would be https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/apt-groups. When you have determined the APT Group you want to research - find their indicators and ask yourself: " What can I do or what detection rules and approach can I create to detect the adversary's activity?", and "Where does this activity or detection fall on the Pyramid of Pain?‚Äù


As David Blanco states, "the amount of pain you cause an adversary depends on the types of indicators you are able to make use of".
